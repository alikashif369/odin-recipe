    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</p>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p>
